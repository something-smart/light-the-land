Light the Land is a roguelike currently in the VERY early stages of development. Expect numerous bugs and probably crashes. Balance is not even on my radar yet.

### Goal
To win, you must complete 10 levels. Each level consists of a grid-based map, with all of the tiles hidden initially. Your objective is to discover a certain number of beacons and power them by connecting them with cables to a generator, which is in the corner of the map where the player starts. The map is made up of different types of terrain, which have different effects.

### Gameplay
You have a limited amount of energy for the level; discovering a new tile and placing a cable each cost 2 energy (although some terrains may modify this). You may also attempt to discover and place a cable on a tile at the same time; this only costs 3 energy, but risks losing the cable if it cannot be placed on that tile.

### Shop
Between levels, there will be a shop where you can buy various items and upgrades. You receive some reward money at the end of each level, plus you can earn money by opening chests and discovering caves within a level.
There are three types of items:
- Enhancements: Passive abilities that automatically help you.
- Gadgets: Items that must be placed on the map and powered to have an effect, along with paying an energy cost. Some have an immediate effect when placed, others provide a bonus for the rest of the level.
- Tools: These only have an energy cost, and provide an immediate effect when used.

Each gadget may only be used once per level. Each tool may also only be used once per level, but it is possible to get multiple copies of the same tool.

The shop also allows you to choose from 3 potential next levels; you will be able to see the biome (which affects terrain frequency), map size, and reward money when choosing.

### Controls
Click on a discovered tile - move there

Click on an undiscovered tile - discover it

Cable button or press C - use a cable on the next tile you click on

Lumber button or press B - build a bridge on the next tile you click on (this will make sense eventually)

Click on a tool - use that tool (click on the tile to use it on after, if necessary)

Click on a gadget - use that gadget on the tile you are on. The tile must not have a gadget yet and it must be powered.

Press T - toggle tooltips if they're annoying
